## Overview

`InfrastructureSystems.jl` is a [`Julia`](http://www.julialang.org) package that utilities for
the packages in NREL's [SIIP Initiative](https://github.com/NREL-SIIP). This package is meant for package development. It is used primarily by
[PowerSystems.jl](https://github.com/NREL-SIIP/PowerSystems.jl) and
[PowerSimulations.jl](https://github.com/NREL-SIIP/PowerSimulations.jl) but is
written to be extensible for other kinds of applications as well within.

This document describes how to integrate it with other packages.
