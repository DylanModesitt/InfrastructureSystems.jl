The `Systems.jl` package provides a rigorous data model using Julia structures to enable power systems analysis. In addition to stand-alone system analysis tools and model building, the `Systems.jl` package is used as the foundational data container for the [PowerSystems.jl](https://github.com/NREL/PowerSystems.jl) package.
